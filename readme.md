## Build a House Game

Building a house. Buy materials. Try to outsmart the market.

### Commands

Use the app flag (m/c = mobile, d/e = desktop) to specify the destination.

Development: `grunt d`
Production:  `grunt p`

## Status

It's a little broken in this state. I wanted to move it to a browser interface but the NPM module for console input isn't there so need to swap it to web input. Not a problem there, really, just needs to be done.

To get it running, run
`npm install`

Then
`grunt d`

Then in the build folder run
`node game.js`

## Win conditions

- If you buy at average price, roughly on time, you should win.
- If you buy above market on average, you should lose
- If you buy below market on average, you should win
- If you buy below market on average, but too early, you should lose

You almost died. You spent most of your life being careful, and your life savings was wiped out after a single car accident.

You decide you're not living life carefully anymore. You're going to take some risks. Starting with taking time away from work to build the home of your dreams.

First you have to get the money. You can scrape enough cash together to live for about 6 months, but nothing to put into the house construction itself.

The bank laughs at you. With no downpayment, and a crippled credit score after delayed payment on too many hospital bills, you're not getting a standard loan.

Then you find Jimmy's House Of House Credit For House Making. They seem sketchy, but they're willing to make you a deal. Here are the terms:

$500,000 credit line for building your house.

The interest rate is an outrageous 32% until the house is complete. But because it's a credit line, you don't get charged interest until you use the money. Interest payments are due at the end of every 4 weeks.

You have 26 Weeks to build your house and pass all inspections, or they take the house, your credit line, and you're on the hook for any interest accrued.

Once the house is complete, you should be able to refinance, get back to work, and afford the mortgage payments.


Week 4 News:

The market for building materials has become really volatile thanks to a recent tropical storm that destroyed the a local seaside town, which needs to be rebuilt, and the docks through which all your materials would have arrived.

Random nonsense you buy at the hardware store each day!
